"""Append-only audit log (spec §12).

Every mutating operation appends one JSON line:
``{ts, actor, action, urn, mac, hash, prev}``. Each entry carries a
``prev`` field = SHA-256 of the previous entry's line (including its newline),
so the log is a hash chain: ``pd verify`` can walk it exactly like the node
chain and detect a deleted or reordered middle entry.

The log is opened in append mode only — it never truncates. ``prev`` makes
that property *checkable* rather than merely conventional.
