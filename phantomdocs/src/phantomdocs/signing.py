"""Mutation signing (issue #30 v2): bind authorship to the actor's Nostr key.

PhantomDocs' integrity guarantee (chained MACs) detects *tampering* but not
*who* wrote a node: a process with filesystem write access can add a node
with a valid MAC. The v2 authorization boundary binds each mutation to the
actor that made it, using the persona's existing Nostr identity
(``npub`` in org.yaml, ``nsec`` in the persona's vault):

  - a mutating command MAY sign the node MAC with the actor's nsec
    (``PHANTOMDOCS_NSEC`` env or ``--nsec-file``);
  - the signature + x-only pubkey are recorded on the node and in the audit
    entry;
  - ``pd verify --org-yaml`` then checks that a signed node's signature
    verifies against the actor's declared ``npub``, so an unauthorized write
    (signed with the wrong key, or unsigned where the namespace requires
    signatures) leaves a detectable trace.

Nostr uses BIP-340 Schnorr over secp256k1 with x-only (32-byte) public keys.
The message signed is a **canonical mutation envelope** — a deterministic
serialization of the node MAC together with the authorization-relevant fields
(actor, action, category, owners, locations, urn) — domain-separated by a
fixed prefix so a signature can never be replayed across a different protocol.

Signing the envelope (rather than the bare MAC) is what makes the v2
boundary an *authorization* boundary and not merely a tamper seal: the MAC
covers only content identity, so a signature over the MAC alone cannot
prevent one declared actor from authenticating a mutation asserted as a
different actor, or a mutation whose category/owners/locations were swapped
underneath a still-valid MAC. Binding those fields into the signed message
means ``verify`` can reconstruct the exact envelope from the stored node and
reject a signature that does not cover the node as it currently stands.
