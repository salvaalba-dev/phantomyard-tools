"""Document application service — the mutating document workflows (issue #46).

The service is the *enforcement point*, not a convenience wrapper around the
CLI (issue #69). It establishes its own security context:

  1. loads the org.yaml from a trusted location and validates its schema;
  2. requires the claimed actor to be a declared actor in that org model;
  3. when signing is configured, derives the signing key's pubkey and verifies
     it maps to the claimed actor's declared ``npub`` **at mutation time** —
     so a caller cannot assert "I am actor X" and sign with an unrelated key,
     and cannot forge the org model to grant itself access.

The caller supplies *intent* (a slug, a category, owners, content); the
service supplies and verifies *authority*. All failures raise
:class:`DocumentError` with a user-facing message; the CLI maps it onto
``click.ClickException``.
