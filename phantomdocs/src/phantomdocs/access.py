"""Access resolution from a PhantomOrg org.yaml (spec §9).

PhantomDocs does NOT define its own ACL: it consumes PhantomOrg's
`policies.access_levels` + `policies.security_categories` and the role/actor
exception fields, and checks whether an actor's resolved access covers a
node's category. Fail-closed: no rule -> denied.

Categories are hierarchical: the hierarchy is declared in
``policies.security_categories``, where each category carries an optional
``scope``, ``owner`` and ``parent``. When a category declares ``parent``,
that field is the authority for the hierarchy (issue #100) and the
``-``-prefix in an id is only canonical *naming*; when no category declares
``parent``, the hierarchy falls back to the longest declared ``-``-prefix
(issue #45). In both modes the link only ever connects *declared*
categories, never a blind string match; an undeclared category is denied
(fail-closed).
