# PhantomDocs — Specification v0.1 (agnostic)

**Status:** Draft for review — 2026-08-19
**Project language:** English (all code, docs and comments)

---

## 1. Purpose

PhantomDocs is a **self-contained document management tool** for the
phantomyard ecosystem. It gives phantombot personas of any
PhantomOrg-provisioned organization the ability to **autonomously manage
their entity's documents and document requests**, with guarantees of:

- **Identity** — every document and folder carries a unique, verifiable
  identifier.
- **Integrity** — content is hash-bound; corruption and accidental
  divergence are detectable by re-verification. (The chain is unkeyed:
  authenticity/tamper-evidence is the optional HMAC in §4.3.)
- **Access control** — resolved from PhantomOrg (access levels, security
  categories, role/actor exceptions) and **enforced** on every read/write;
  PhantomDocs only declares each node's classification.
- **Location** — every node maps to a physical path or URL, independent of
  backend and operating system.
- **Search** — index-, full-text- and backend-native search.

It is **standalone** (a tool subdirectory, same pattern as PhantomOrg /
PhantomBridge / PhantomMeet): it *consumes* PhantomOrg but does not modify it.

## 2. Concepts (generic)

| Concept | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Namespace** | The document tree of one organization (e.g. `ecda`) |
| **Node** | A folder or a document in the tree |
| **Identity header (MAC)** | The per-node cryptographic identifier in the chained identity scheme (§4) — a SHA-256 hash-chain header (not a Message Authentication Code; see §4.1) |
| **Content hash** | SHA-256 of a document's bytes |
| **Ref** | A mutable pointer to a version MAC (e.g. `latest`, `approved-<date>`) — the `git` branch/tag equivalent |
| **Manifest** | The single source of truth mapping identity → location → metadata → classification → relations |
| **Backend** | A storage adapter (`local`, `ssh`, `gdrive`) that reads/writes blobs |
| **Blob** | The raw bytes of a document, addressed by its content hash |
| **Actor** | A persona (resolved via PhantomOrg) performing an operation |
| **Category** | A document's security classification, referencing PhantomOrg's `security_categories` |

## 4. Identity model: chained headers (MAC)

Every node's identifier **inherits its parent's header and appends its own** —
a hash chain with inheritance:

```
H(x) = SHA-256(x)

root MAC   = H( org_pubkey || namespace )      # tree root (org + namespace)
node MAC   = H( parent_MAC || component )      # inherit parent + append own

component(folder) = slug                       # folders are structural
component(doc)    = slug || H(content)         # docs bind name + content

# versioned docs chain off their predecessor, not the tree parent
v1 = H( parent_MAC || slug || H(content) )     # first version: tree parent
vN = H( v_{N-1} || slug || H(content) )        # later versions: predecessor
```

Properties this provides:

- **Lineage embedded** — a node's MAC encodes its full path (chain of parents).
  To locate a node you walk the tree; to verify it you recompute from the root.
- **Version history chained** — a document version's MAC binds its predecessor,
  so the version history is a second hash chain; tampering with `previous` or
  rolling back to older content both produce a distinct, recomputable identity.
- **Tamper cascade** — altering a parent (rename / move / corruption)
  invalidates the MACs of all its descendants automatically. Fail-closed by
  construction.
- **Content binding** — a document's component includes `H(content)`, so its
  identity is bound to its bytes; any edit yields a new MAC.
- **Deterministic and auditable** — every chain segment maps to a readable slug.

### 4.1 Terminology note

"MAC" here means the **identity header** — a SHA-256 hash-chain value that
identifies a node — *not* a Message Authentication Code. (RFC 6920 calls the
general idea "naming things with hashes"; the only true MAC in this design is
the optional HMAC authenticity signature in §4.3.)

Each node is addressed at two levels:

| Level    | Form                                              | Consumer |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Logical  | `actas/2026-08-19-reunion-junta.md`               | humans   |
| Identity | `urn:<org>:doc:<path>` + `sha2-256-256:<64 hex>`  | bots     |

### 4.2 Identifier format (self-describing)

Identifiers are **self-describing**, following the `multihash` / RFC 6920
convention `<algorithm>-<bits>:<hex>` rather than a bare truncated hash, so the
scheme can evolve without lock-in:

- **Full (verification):** `sha2-256-256:<64 hex>` — the whole MAC, used for
  integrity checks and stored in the manifest.
- **Display (human):** `sha2-256-128:<32 hex>` — a 128-bit truncation for
  readable short forms (RFC 6920 registers `sha-256-128` for exactly this).
- **Truncation floor:** never truncate below 128 bits for anything security-
  relevant (a 64-bit "short id" has a ~2^32 birthday bound and is display-only,
  if used at all).

This mirrors `multihash` (`<fn-code><length><digest>`) and RFC 6920's `ni://`
scheme, and the two-tier split (stable logical name + content-derived ID) is
the same pattern as `git` refs/SHAs, IPFS paths/CIDs, and Software Heritage
SWHIDs (`swh:1:<type>:<hash>`).

### 4.3 Authenticity & aggregation (optional)

- **Authenticity** — the manifest's root MAC is signed with an HMAC using the
  entity key (same envelope-MAC pattern as PhantomBridge), proving origin and
  integrity.
- **Merkle aggregation (v2)** — a folder's MAC aggregates the hashes of its
  children so a folder also "summarizes" its whole subtree. Not required for
  v1; the chain already covers identity + per-document verification.

## 5. Operating model: GitHub/git (reference)

GitHub is the reference operating model: git is already a **content-addressed
Merkle DAG**, so it validates the chained-MAC identity scheme and gives a proven
vocabulary for every other PhantomDocs concern.

| GitHub / git concept      | PhantomDocs equivalent                                  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| repository                | namespace                                               |
| directory / file          | folder / document                                       |
| blob (SHA of content)     | blob (SHA-256 of content)                               |
| commit (parent + tree)    | chained MAC: `H(parent_MAC ∥ component)`               |
| history / DAG             | versioning + audit trail                                |
| branch / tag              | logical pointers to versions                            |
| org teams & members       | PhantomOrg roles & actors (identity)                    |
| CODEOWNERS (per path)     | per-node classification + optional owners (permissions) |
| pull request review       | document request → review → approve → merge workflow    |
| issues                    | user document requests (solicitudes)                    |
| blame / history           | audit log (`who changed what, when`)                    |
| remote + local            | agnostic backends (`local://`, `ssh://`, `gdrive://`)   |

The **pull-request flow** is the operational answer to the goal of autonomous
request handling: a user opens an *issue* (request) → a persona reviews/edits a
*branch* → approval → *merge* (commit) → history updated (audit). The org↔repo
split (org owns teams, repo maps teams→permissions via CODEOWNERS) is exactly
the PhantomOrg↔PhantomDocs split of §9.

## 6. Manifest-driven design

All organization-specific values live in a single YAML manifest per namespace.
PhantomDocs ships with **zero hardcoded values**.

```yaml
manifest:
  version: 1
  org: "ecda"
  tenant: "single"               # v1 fixed; "multi" => error reported below
  rootMac: "a3f1c9..."           # H(org_pubkey || namespace)
  signedRootMac: "..."           # optional HMAC with the entity key

nodes:
  - urn: "urn:ecda:folder:actas"
    mac: "8b2c44..."
    parentMac: "a3f1c9..."
    kind: folder
    slug: "actas"
    category: 1                  # classification → PhantomOrg security_categories

  - urn: "urn:ecda:doc:actas/2026-08-19-reunion-junta.md"
    mac: "9d4e7a..."
    parentMac: "8b2c44..."
    kind: doc
    slug: "2026-08-19-reunion-junta.md"
    contentHash: "e7f0aa..."
    size: 12345
    category: 2                  # confidential — access resolved from org.yaml
    owners: [cfo]                # optional — PhantomOrg role ids allowed to write
    locations:
      - backend: "gdrive"
        url: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/..."
        verifiedAt: "2026-08-19T16:00:00Z"
    meta:
      title: "Board meeting minutes 2026-08-19"
      author: "cfo"
    relations:
      references: ["urn:ecda:doc:normativa/purchasing-policy.md"]
```

### 6.1 Single-tenant v1 (multi-tenancy reported as unsupported)

Version 1 supports exactly **one organization per deployment** (derived from
the PhantomOrg org model). The manifest reserves the `tenant` field so v2 can
add multi-tenancy without breaking the schema. If a manifest declares
`tenant: multi` (or references more than one org namespace), the tool
**reports "multi-tenancy is not supported in this version"** and refuses to
operate (fail-closed). The architecture leaves the slot for v2; the capability
is simply not advertised as available.

### 6.2 Root + head seal (external trust anchor, issues #70/#71)

`verify()` alone proves *internal* consistency (MAC chains, hash lineage,
audit hash chain), not that the root is authentic — an attacker with manifest
write access can forge the root and recompute descendants. PhantomDocs adds an
external anchor sealed by the **org key**:

- `pd seal --nsec-file <org.nsec>` signs a **head commitment** — `rootMac`,
  `headSeq`, `headMac`, `auditSeq`, `auditHead` — with the org's nsec. The
  result is stored in the manifest header (`sealPubkey`, `sealedHeadSeq`, …).
- `pd verify --org-pubkey <npub|hex>` recomputes `rootMac = H(org_pubkey ||
  namespace)` and verifies the seal, so a forged root (recomputed descendants
  included) no longer verifies.
- `pd verify --expected-head-seq <n>` supplies an external *known-current*
  sequence: a complete rollback of the namespace to an earlier head is
  detected even if the attacker re-seals.

**Trust-anchor policy (decision 2):** `--org-pubkey` is **mandatory** for any
*sealed* namespace — `pd verify` fails closed when a sealed manifest is
verified without it, rather than silently skipping the root + seal anchor.
`--expected-head-seq` is the *rollback* defense and is **required for
high-assurance / audit verification** (where an out-of-band record of the
current head exists); day-to-day verification may omit it, accepting that a
whole-state rollback to an older internally-consistent sealed copy is then
undetectable.

### 6.3 Single authoritative writer host (deployment boundary)

PhantomDocs v1 supports **exactly one authoritative writer host per
namespace** (Model A). All mutating commands (`mkdir`, `add`, `tag`,
`rollback`, `seal`) must run on that host, serialized by the inter-process
`manifest.lock`.

The lock is **host-local**: it uses `fcntl.flock` (POSIX) or `msvcrt` range
locking (Windows), which serializes concurrent *processes on the same host*
but does **not** coordinate across hosts. Two hosts writing the same namespace
would both read `head = N`, both commit `seq = N+1`, and fork the head —
neither `verify` nor the seal can distinguish the two branches.

Multi-host writing is therefore **not supported** in v1 and is a fail-closed
boundary: a deployment with more than one writer host is misconfigured.
Multi-writer support (Model B) requires a distributed compare-and-swap /
locking primitive in the backend and is deferred to a future version. Until
then the single-writer constraint is a *documented deployment requirement*,
not a runtime-enforced guarantee across hosts.

## 7. Naming convention

Deterministic, human-readable and bot-parseable:

```
<domain>/<type>/<date>-<slug>.<ext>
```

Examples:

- `minutes/2026-08-19-board-meeting.md`
- `policy/purchasing-policy.md`
- `contracts/2026-08-01-venue-lease.pdf`

Rules:

- lowercase, kebab-case, ASCII (no accents or spaces).
- date in ISO-8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- `ext` = the real file format.
- **Do not** encode version in the name: real versioning is given by the
  content hash. Slugs must stay stable.
- `domain` and `type` come from a **controlled vocabulary** defined in
  `org.yaml`, so naming is consistent across the whole entity (and machine-
  checkable).

## 8. Storage adapters (agnostic)

A storage-adapter layer. Every node is a **blob** (bytes) + its hash; the
adapter only reads / writes / lists bytes. The OS is irrelevant because
everything flows through this layer.

- `local://` — local filesystem (Linux / macOS / Windows).
- `ssh://` — remote host over SSH (reuses the ecosystem's existing SSH aliases).
- `gdrive://` — Google Drive via OAuth2 (already solved by `gog` /
  `workspace.py`).

A node may declare several `locations` (replicas), each verified by hash.

**Drive upload idempotency + ambiguous success (issue #79).** `gdrive://`
`put` forwards the content hash as `--content-hash <hex>`, which the persona's
`workspace.py drive-upload --folder <name>` MUST treat as the upload's
idempotency key: identical bytes resolve to the **same** Drive file id
(content-addressed dedup) instead of duplicating the object. A failed `put`
does **not** prove that no remote object was created — the upload may have
succeeded while the response (and file id) was lost. Callers must treat `put`
failures as retryable, and the idempotency contract is what keeps those
retries duplicate-free.

**Index by reference:** `add --ref <uri>` indexes an object that already
lives elsewhere without copying it into a content-addressed store. The
location stores a `ref` key. For `ssh://` the `ref` is kept as the **full
canonical URI** (`ssh://[user@]host[:port]/path`) so `get`/`verify` can
re-read the object later (a bare path would drop host/user/port); the remote
path is shell-quoted before being interpolated into the remote `cat`, so a
path containing metacharacters is read as a literal filename, never executed.

## 9. Access control (resolved from PhantomOrg)

PhantomOrg is the **authoritative access model**. PhantomDocs does **not**
define its own ACL; it reuses what PhantomOrg already provides and enforces it
on documents.

What PhantomOrg already owns (see `org.yaml` + `compiler/access.py` +
`compiler/scopes.py`):

- **`policies.access_levels`** — RBAC tiers with numeric category sets
  (e.g. `level-3 → [1,2,3]`, `level-2 → [1,2]`, `level-1 → [1]`).
- **`policies.security_categories`** — document classifications
  (`category-1` public, `category-2` confidential, `category-3` credentials /
  sensitive financial, `category-0` absolute exception).
- **`merge_access()`** — hybrid resolution: base RBAC (`access_level`) +
  role exceptions (`security_exceptions`) + actor exceptions (`actor_exceptions`).
- **`derive_scopes()`** — per-actor visibility (rules `chain` / `department`).

What PhantomDocs adds per node is **one field**: `category` — the node's
security classification, referencing PhantomOrg's `security_categories`.

**Enforcement (fail-closed):**

- The **actor identity** is resolved with layered precedence
  (issue #29): an explicit `--actor` flag → the `PHANTOMDOCS_ACTOR` environment
  variable → the OS username (`pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid())`). In the
  PhantomOrg/phantombot deployment model N personas live as directories under
  ONE OS account and phantombot gives focus to one persona at a time, so the OS
  username is **not** the persona identity. PhantomDocs never requires
  phantombot (or any core app) to change: each persona's own tool wrapper
  (`tools/documents.sh`, installed by `pd setup` — §13) pins `--actor`, and
  `PHANTOMDOCS_ACTOR` remains an optional operator-supplied override. Both are
  phantomtools-side; there is no phantombot hook.
  The OS username is kept only as a fallback for deployments that genuinely run
  one persona per OS account (e.g. the VPS Virtualmin model). The resolved id
  must be a declared actor `id` in `org.yaml`; an unmapped actor is refused.
  Without `--org-yaml` (the authoritative org model) and a resolvable actor,
  read and write are denied — never fail-open.

**Threat model (issue #30):** integrity and authorization are two different
guarantees, and only one of them is cryptographically enforced.

- **Integrity is guaranteed by the MAC chain.** Every node's identity is a
  chained hash (`H(parent_MAC ∥ component)`) and every document binds
  `H(content)`; `pd verify` recomputes the chain and detects any tampering,
  regardless of who did it.
- **Authorization is a guardrail, not a cryptographic boundary.** The ACL
  (category + owners) is resolved from PhantomOrg and enforced at the CLI
  layer. The manifest is a plain file: a process with filesystem write access
  can add nodes with valid MACs directly, bypassing both the ACL and the
  append-only audit log. In the phantombot threat model the personas are
  trusted processes sharing one account, and the ACL exists to constrain what
  the model's tool use may touch — not to stop a malicious process that can
  already write the filesystem.

  Binding authorship cryptographically is the v2 authorization boundary,
  now implemented (issue #30): a mutating command MAY sign the node with the
  actor's Nostr nsec (``PHANTOMDOCS_NSEC`` or ``--nsec-file``). The message
  signed is a **canonical mutation envelope** — the node MAC together with
  the authorization-relevant fields (actor, action, category, owners,
  locations, urn) — so the BIP-340 Schnorr signature binds *who* made the
  mutation and *what* it was authorized to do, not just the content identity.
  The signature + x-only pubkey are recorded on the node and in the audit
  entry. ``pd verify --org-yaml`` then (a) verifies each signature against the
  recorded pubkey over the reconstructed envelope and (b) rejects a signature
  whose key does not match the **specific actor recorded on the node** (one
  declared actor's key can no longer authenticate a mutation asserted as a
  different actor, and changing category/owners/locations after signing
  invalidates the signature). This detects an unauthorized write signed with
  the wrong key (or tampered after signing); it is an opt-in boundary —
  unsigned mutations remain valid for namespaces that have not adopted
  signing.

  A `tag` mutation signs the same envelope with the **ref name** bound in
  (a `ref` field, present only for `tag`), and the resulting signature is
  stored on the ref record in `manifest.refs` (alongside the target MAC and
  actor). `pd verify --org-yaml` validates each signed ref over the current
  ref name + target MAC, so a ref renamed or repointed after tagging fails
  verification.

  **Mutation timestamp + key lifecycle (issue #76).** The canonical envelope
  also binds a `ts` (ISO-8601 UTC) — the moment the mutation was authorized —
  recorded on the node/ref. Combined with the actor's **key registry** in
  `org.yaml`, this gives rotation and revocation:

  ```yaml
  actors:
    - id: alice
      role: ceo
      npub: npub_current        # active signing key
      keys:                     # optional: full key lifecycle
        - npub: npub_old
          valid_from: "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"   # optional
          valid_until: "2026-06-01T00:00:00Z"  # optional
          revoked_at: null                     # set to a timestamp to revoke
      actor_exceptions: []
  ```

  - **Rotation** — an actor declares a dated window (`valid_from`/
    `valid_until`) per key; `verify --org-yaml` evaluates the signature key
    against the window *at the node's `ts`*, so rotating to a new `npub` does
    not retroactively invalidate history signed with the old key.
  - **Revocation** — `revoked_at` marks a key invalid from that timestamp on;
    signatures made before it still verify, after it fail. A revoked key also
    cannot sign new mutations (the service rejects it at mutation time).
  - **Legacy nodes (pre-#76)** — a signed node with no `ts` is still verified:
    the rotation window cannot be evaluated, so the key is checked against the
    *current* registry (declared and not revoked). This preserves verifiability
    of pre-#76 manifests while keeping revocation fail-closed.
  - **Key-file hygiene** — `--nsec-file` must be a regular file owned by the
    caller with mode 0600 (or tighter): symlinks, group/other-readable files,
    and wrong-owner files are refused.
- **Read** — allowed iff the actor's resolved access (`merge_access`) covers
  the node's `category` (i.e. the category number is in the actor's resolved
  category set, or the actor holds a category exception). `category-0` is
  readable only by actors with the `category-0` exception.
- **Write / delete** — allowed iff read is allowed **and** the actor is in the
  node's write scope. In v1 the write scope is the node's explicit `owners`
  list (PhantomOrg role ids **or** actor ids) and is **required**: a write
  with no declared owners is denied. (The §9 fallback — the actors in the same
  reporting `chain` scope — is deferred rather than re-derived in a second,
  drifting implementation of PhantomOrg's `derive_scopes`.) No rule → denied.

This mirrors the GitHub split exactly: PhantomOrg = the *org* (teams/members =
roles/actors), the PhantomDocs manifest = the *repo* (CODEOWNERS-style
classification + optional owners). The manifest is **derived, not hand-edited**:
`pd derive-manifest` reads `org.yaml` to resolve roles/actors and validate the
naming vocabulary, so nothing is duplicated.

## 10. Search

- **Index (always available):** grep over the manifest (urn, slug, meta).
- **Local:** SQLite FTS5 over extracted text + names + metadata.
- **gdrive:** Google Drive search API (`files.list q=...`).
- Result = ranked URNs; the bot returns the logical (readable) path.

## 11. Relationships

Graph in the manifest: `references`, `derived-from`, `version-of`, `related-to`.
Enables queries like "which minutes cite this policy?".

## 12. Integrity: versioning, backup, verification, audit

- **Versioning** — content-addressed: each version is a new blob with its own
  hash; the manifest keeps the current version + the MAC history per URN. A
  version *is* its MAC (immutable) — filenames never encode version numbers.
- **Refs (mutable pointers)** — `latest` / `approved-<date>` pointers in the
  manifest resolve a logical name to a version MAC (the `git` branch/tag
  equivalent); approving a document is tagging a MAC. A signed `tag` stores
  the signature on the ref record, binding the ref name to the target MAC
  (see §9), so a ref renamed or repointed after tagging is detected by
  `pd verify`.
- **Backup** — `pd backup` copies blobs + manifest to a target backend,
  verifiable by hash.
- **Verification (cotejo)** — `pd verify` recomputes the MAC chain and content
  hashes against the manifest and reports any divergence.
- **Audit** — an append-only, **hash-chained** log (`audit.log`) records
  `{ts, actor, action, urn, mac, hash, prev}` where `prev` is the SHA-256 of
  the preceding line; `pd verify` walks the chain and reports a deleted or
  reordered entry. The `actor` field is the **authenticated OS identity** — the
  same verified actor used for authorization, never a self-asserted label.
  Without this there is no "total guarantee" worth the name.
- **Recovery** — `pd recover` re-aligns the audit log with the manifest after
  an interrupted audit-first transaction (issue #74): it discards orphaned audit
  entries (mutations whose manifest commit never landed) and refuses fail-closed
  on any other divergence (tampering, not a crash).

## 13. Update package (what PhantomDocs applies)

Idempotent and strictly **phantomtools-side**: applied on top of a PhantomOrg
persona installation by `pd setup`. PhantomDocs never requires phantombot — or
any core app — to grow per-tool hooks; the package only writes into the
persona's own files and consumes `org.yaml`.

- `kb/procedures/Documents.md` — document-management protocol per persona
  (rendered from templates, bounded by `<!-- phantomdocs:start/end -->` markers).
- `MEMORY.md` — a compact pointer to the protocol (same marker convention).
- `tools/documents.sh` — a generated wrapper pinning `--actor <id>` (the
  per-persona stopgap for a fixed actor; no phantombot-side injection). The
  wrapper injects `--actor`/`--org-yaml` **after** the selected subcommand
  (they are command-local Click options) and only for subcommands that accept
  them, honouring an explicit operator override.
- `documents.inboxes` in `org.yaml` — each persona's Drive inbox (`{name, id}`),
  consumed by `pd setup` so the protocol references the inbox by id.

## 14. Security

- ACL resolved from PhantomOrg and enforced fail-closed; no rule → denied.
- Identity + integrity via the chained MAC; optional HMAC authenticity.
- Secrets never stored in the manifest; backends reuse the persona's existing
  credentials (SSH keys, OAuth2).
- Audit log is append-only and hash-chained (`prev` = SHA-256 of the prior line).
- **Crypto agility (decision 3):** the crypto-suite version (`cryptoVersion`,
  v1 = BIP-340 Schnorr + SHA-256) is bound into every signed mutation envelope
  and the sealed manifest header — authenticated state, not implementation
  convention — so a future v2 can verify v1 while v1 refuses v2 (fail-closed).
- **Confidentiality at rest (decision 4):** v1 provides integrity +
  authenticity, **not** encryption-at-rest — blobs are stored as plaintext, so a
  filesystem / backend reader can read document contents (though not alter them
  undetected). Encryption-at-rest + key management is a **required phase-2
  capability** (declared, not yet designed); until then confidentiality relies
  on the storage layer's own encryption (disk, Drive, permissions).

## 15. Integration with PhantomOrg

- Personas are provisioned by PhantomOrg (`po build` / `po deploy`) from an org
  model.
- PhantomDocs sits **on top** and consumes `org.yaml` for: roles/actors, the
  access model (`access_levels` + `security_categories` + exceptions), the scope
  rules, and the naming vocabulary. It never modifies PhantomOrg itself.

## 16. Roadmap

- **MVP (v0.1):** manifest + chained MAC + adapters `local`/`ssh`/`gdrive` +
  add/read + `verify` + index search + ACL resolved from PhantomOrg
  (fail-closed) + basic append-only audit + `pd update`.
- **v0.2:** versioning + relationships + backup + queryable audit with retention.
- **v2 (future):** multi-tenancy, folder Merkle aggregation, full local FTS5,
  sync/replication, encryption-at-rest + key management (decision 4).

## 17. Open questions

- Confirm the exact interface PhantomOrg exposes at build time (branch
  `feat/phantomorg`) so `pd derive-manifest` can consume it without duplicating
  the access model.
- Confirm whether the chain root uses the org's Nostr `org_pubkey` or a tool-
  owned identifier.
- Define the initial `domain`/`type` vocabulary and `security_categories` usage
  for the first target org.
- Confirm the CLI binary name (`pd`) and package layout (`phantomdocs/`).
