"""
Phantomchat generation: compile phantomchat.json from the org model.

Contrast with ``phantomchat.py`` (verification-only): this module GENERATES
the runtime ``phantomchat.json`` for every actor that declares a Nostr npub.
It is the "compile" layer of the phantomchat plan — org.yaml declares the
channels (private relay, bridge npub, human npubs) and the actor identities
(``actors[].npub``), and each persona gets a ready-to-deploy phantomchat.json
with:

- ``relays``: the optional public relays, then the org private relay last. The
  runtime replaces this list with the served ``PHANTOMCHAT_RELAYS_URL`` list on
  its first fetch, so this is the initial/offline order and is kept consistent
  with what the deployment actually serves.
- ``allowed_npubs``: explicitly designated PRINCIPALS only (``principal_npubs``).
  The shared human group identity (``human_npubs``), relays, the bridge and
  peer actors are delivery endpoints, never promoted to principal trust.
- ``greeted`` is intentionally empty: onboarding must remain visible to the
  operator and must not silently establish trust.

The file is derived state (like the norma): fully regenerated on every
build, written with write_plain_if_changed, never block-merged. Actors
without an npub simply get no phantomchat.json (build() warns about them).
