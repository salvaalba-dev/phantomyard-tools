# PhantomMeet

**Agnostic meeting capabilities layer for PhantomOrg-provisioned personas.**

PhantomMeet gives AI personas of any PhantomOrg-provisioned organization
everything they need to run, join, and follow up on meetings:

- **Participate** in meeting rooms as text-only attendees via a bridge
- **Record** meetings and **list** recordings
- **Transcribe** and **store** each meeting's artifacts where its responsible decides
- **Upload** artifacts to Google Drive with the **Google Drive API** via
  `workspace.py drive-upload` (a persona whose workspace tooling already has
  Drive access — service account with domain-wide delegation or OAuth2).
  See [docs/SPEC.md §6.1](docs/SPEC.md#61-storing-artifacts--google-drive-api-upload-reference-case)
- **Logistics**: create/invite/open meetings from Google Calendar
- **Configurable invitation card**: multi-line template with tokens
  (`%TITLE%`, `%RECIPIENTS%`, `%DATETIME%`, `%LINK%`, `%ROOM%`,
  `%PASSWORD_LINE%`), validated at load — `%TITLE%`, `%DATETIME%`, `%LINK%`
  mandatory, the rest optional. Set via `pm apply --ask-card` (interactive)
  or `--card-file FILE` (one-shot); `base` restores the packaged template,
  `clear` falls back to the built-in ES/EN format. Room passwords are
  **declared** (`--password-vault`/`--password-file`) but **never read nor
  broadcast**: the card shows a "shared separately" notice.
- **Unified recording naming**: meeting room name == recording file name
  (`{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HH-MM}_{topic}`); recording storage in the org's
  `storage.drive_folder` (e.g. `Grabaciones`).

It is an **update package applied on top of a PhantomOrg installation**: it
adds knowledge, tools and configuration to the provisioned personas without
breaking the existing installation.

## Agnostic by design

PhantomMeet contains **zero hardcoded organization data**. Everything
organization-specific lives in a single YAML **manifest**:

```yaml
org: my-org
language: en            # en | es  (language of generated persona content)
bridge:
  relay: ws://host:7777
  npub: npub-bridge
rooms:
  suffix: "@conference.domain"
  naming: "{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HH-MM}_{topic}"
roles:                  # persona → directive role
  maria: responsible
  juan: support
permissions:
  full: [maria]
  restricted:
    projectx: [juan]
storage:
  decided_by: responsible   # the tool never imposes a location
  cleanup_after_confirm: true
```

See `examples/example-org.yaml` for a complete reference manifest.

## What it applies (idempotent)

Per persona, PhantomMeet manages:

- `kb/procedures/Meetings.md` — role-aware meeting protocol with OKF
  frontmatter; the generated body lives between `<!-- phantommeet:start/end -->`
  markers, so anything the persona adds outside the markers is preserved
- `MEMORY.md` — a one-line pointer to `kb/procedures/Meetings.md` between
  `<!-- phantommeet:start -->` / `<!-- phantommeet:end -->` markers (procedural
  content stays in the KB, never in the persona's curated memory)
- `phantomchat.json` — private relay ensured present (its position is left
  untouched: the runtime resolves the list from the served source); bridge npub
  registered in `relay_npubs` (phantombot's untrusted relay tier — never
  `allowed_npubs`, which is a trust grant) and evicted from `allowed_npubs` when
  a legacy apply
  left it there, with the owned delta recorded to
  `.phantommeet-phantomchat.delta.json` so the patch is reversible
- `legacy_kb_files` — deprecated **in place** (a `> Superseded by
  [[procedures/Meetings]]` banner is prepended); files are never deleted, so
  the KB wikilink graph stays intact

Re-running the apply is safe: unchanged files are skipped.

```bash
# Derive the manifest from a PhantomOrg org model + base manifest
pm derive-manifest --org organizations/<org>/org.yaml \
                  --base examples/<org>.base.yaml \
                  --out examples/<org>.yaml

# Validate a manifest
pm validate --manifest examples/example-org.yaml

# Preview every change without writing
pm apply --manifest examples/example-org.yaml \
         --target ~/.local/share/phantombot/personas --dry-run

# Apply
pm apply --manifest examples/example-org.yaml \
         --target ~/.local/share/phantombot/personas

# Apply, with optional interactive card setup
pm apply --manifest examples/example-org.yaml \
         --target ~/.local/share/phantombot/personas --ask-card

# Verify infrastructure is healthy (read-only) + personas fully applied.
# Report goes to the screen AND to a log file (default
# ~/.local/state/phantommeet/check-infra.log; --log FILE to choose, --no-log to
# disable). Run this on every host at deployment time — it is the
# prerequisites check for the third-party software PhantomMeet needs.
pm check-infra --manifest examples/example-org.yaml \
               --target ~/.local/share/phantombot/personas

# Reverse PhantomMeet's owned changes (phantomchat relay + bridge npub, the
# allowlist eviction, Meetings.md block, MEMORY.md section) without touching
# unrelated operator configuration.
pm unapply --manifest examples/example-org.yaml \
            --target ~/.local/share/phantombot/personas
```

The manifest is **derived, not edited**: `derive-manifest` reads the
organization hierarchy from a PhantomOrg `org.yaml` (directive org roles
→ `responsible`, support org roles → `support` with a restricted room
prefix). See [`docs/SPEC.md` §5.1](docs/SPEC.md#51-deriving-the-manifest-from-a-phantomorg-org-model).

`check-infra` probes the endpoints declared in the manifest's `infra` section
(HTTP, WebSocket NIP-01 round-trip, read-only commands, file/env checks for
local tooling like whisper + summary keys) and verifies every persona is fully
applied. Checks may declare `host:` to run only on a given machine
(`--host vps`); non-matching ones are SKIPped, not failed. Run it on the
meeting host for a complete check. Exit code 0 = healthy. The report is
printed to the screen **and** appended to a log file (`--log FILE`, default
`~/.local/state/phantommeet/check-infra.log`, disable with `--no-log`) — this
is the deployment prerequisites check: PhantomMeet documents its
third-party needs but never installs them; run `check-infra` on each host at
deploy time to verify availability and catch anything missing. See
[`docs/SPEC.md` §5.2](docs/SPEC.md#52-infrastructure-verification-pm-check-infra)
and [`§11.5`](docs/SPEC.md#115-deployment-prerequisites-check-pm-check-infra---log).

## Dependencies & maintenance

PhantomMeet is a thin layer on top of a substantial stack: **self-hosted
Jitsi** (Prosody, Jicofo, Jitsi Videobridge, Jibri), a **private Nostr relay**
(locally patched), **Phantombot** personas and **Google Workspace**
(Calendar/Drive). Transcription is done locally with **Whisper**
(faster-whisper, no API costs).

All of these require ongoing maintenance (security updates, relay patch
re-basing, recording cleanup, TLS renewal, OAuth refresh). Read
[`docs/SPEC.md` §11](docs/SPEC.md#11-infrastructure-third-party-software--maintenance)
for the full infrastructure, dependency and maintenance obligations before
deploying. This is **not an install-and-forget project**.

## Status

- **2026-08-07** — Spec v0.2 (agnostic). Update package v0.2.0 implemented and
  tested locally (idempotency verified; en/es + multi-org proven). Applied to
  the reference installation and verified.
- **2026-08-07** — Phase 4 E2E done in the reference deployment: Jibri
  recording → Whisper transcription → DeepSeek summary → token-protected
  download URLs → **Google Drive API upload** by the responsible persona
  (`workspace.py drive-upload`) — fully autonomous, no
  technician needed in day-to-day operation.
- **2026-08-10** — v0.3.0: unified recording naming (`{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HH-MM}_{topic}`, room == file), `storage.drive_folder` convention, and a fully configurable invitation card (`invite.card`, mandatory-token validation, `--ask-card` / `--card-file` interactive setup, org-branded default).

Development happens in the **PhantomTools monorepo**:
PhantomMeet lives in the `phantommeet/` tool subdirectory, same pattern as
PhantomOrg. The subtree carries its own standalone CI (lint + bandit + tests
+ smoke).
